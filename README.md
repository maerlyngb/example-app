# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application


## Overview

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer exists.
Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack][google-phone-gallery]

Each tagged commit is a separate lesson teaching a single aspect of the framework.

The full tutorial can be found at https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.


## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-setup].
- You can find documentation and download git [here][git-home].

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an Angular application.



## Development with `angular-phonecat`

The following docs describe how you can test and develop this application further.

### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower], [Karma][karma] and
[Protractor][protractor]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application
  running.

### Unit Testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Start Karma with `npm test`.
- A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers,
  others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the `karma.conf.js` file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.

### End-to-End Testing

We recommend using [Protractor][protractor] for end-to-end (e2e) testing.

It requires a webserver that serves the application. See the
_Running the Application during Development_ section, above.

- Serve the application with: `npm start`
- In a separate terminal/command line window run the e2e tests: `npm run protractor`.
- Protractor will execute the e2e test scripts against the web application itself. The project is
  set up to run the tests on Chrome directly. If you want to run against other browsers, you must
  modify the configuration at `e2e-tests/protractor-conf.js`.

**Note:**
Under the hood, Protractor uses the [Selenium Standalone Server][selenium], which in turn requires
the [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] to be installed on your local machine. Check this by running
`java -version` from the command line.

If JDK is not already installed, you can download it [here][jdk-download].


## Application Directory Layout

```
app/                     --> all the source code of the app (along with unit tests)
  bower_components/...   --> 3rd party JS/CSS libraries, including Angular and jQuery
  core/                  --> all the source code of the core module (stuff used throughout the app)
    checkmark/...        --> files for the `checkmark` filter, including JS source code, specs
    phone/...            --> files for the `core.phone` submodule, including JS source code, specs
    core.module.js       --> the core module
  img/...                --> image files
  phone-detail/...       --> files for the `phoneDetail` module, including JS source code, HTML templates, specs
  phone-list/...         --> files for the `phoneList` module, including JS source code, HTML templates, specs
  phones/...             --> static JSON files with phone data (used to fake a backend API)
  app.animations.css     --> hooks for running CSS animations with `ngAnimate`
  app.animations.js      --> hooks for running JS animations with `ngAnimate`
  app.config.js          --> app-wide configuration of Angular services
  app.css                --> default stylesheet
  app.module.js          --> the main app module
  index.html             --> app layout file (the main HTML template file of the app)

e2e-tests/               --> config and source files for e2e tests
  protractor.conf.js     --> config file for running e2e tests with Protractor
  scenarios.js           --> e2e specs

node_modules/...         --> development tools (fetched using `npm`)

scripts/                 --> handy scripts
  private/...            --> private scripts used by the Angular Team to maintain this repo
  update-repo.sh         --> script for pulling down the latest version of this repo (!!! DELETES ALL CHANGES YOU HAVE MADE !!!)

bower.json               --> Bower specific metadata, including client-side dependencies
karma.conf.js            --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
